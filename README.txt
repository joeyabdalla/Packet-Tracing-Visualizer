This code reads in a PCAP file and creates a KML file that plots the locations of the source and destination IP addresses on a map.

To use this code, you will need to install wireshark application, install the dpkt and pygeoip libraries. You will also need to download a GeoIP database and specify the file path in the GeoIP function.

Using wireshark you will capture data from your local internet connection and exporting it into a PCAP file.

The code will read in the PCAP file specified in the open function and create a KML document using the plotIPs function. The resulting KML document will be written to a file called sample.kml using the open and write functions.

The KML file can be opened in a program like Google Earth to visualize the plotted IP locations on a map.

Note this code is intended for demonstration purposes only.
